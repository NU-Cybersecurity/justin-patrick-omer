#! /bin/bash

# This script is intended to help users in an offensive and defensive manner when trying to enumerate a local linux machine for permissions issues.
# This could include misconfigured file permissions, user permissions, sudo privileges, etc. 
# After finding an issue, the script will attempt to provide advice for remediation (Dynamic or Static?)

# Okay, so first we need to layout the sections of what we're trying to enumerate. Feel free to add more. I figure the current four is a decent amount? I know there are plenty of other
# Linux Enumeration scripts out there with more but I want to see what we can create on our own and with what we know should be checked.
